**2strapi.bash** Utility to import postgresql tables from a old project to a [Strapi v5](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) project.
              All the Strapi structure files (model, ...) are also created making the table fully useble in the Strapi project.

You have the option to change the name of the destinantion table, meaning that you can also use this utility to clone a table (into same or another project).
